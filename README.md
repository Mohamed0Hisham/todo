To-Do List API

We’re continuing with the APIs for our backend project ideas, this time around for a To-Do application. Why is it different from the previous one?

While the previous project only focused on the main CRUD operations, here we’ll add some more interesting responsibilities, such as:

1. An authentication logic, which means you’ll have to keep a new table of users and their credentials
2. You’ll have to create both users and tasks.
3. You’ll also have to be able to update tasks (their status) and even delete them.
4. Get a list of tasks, filter them by status and get the details of each one.
You’re free to implement this with whatever programming language and framework you want, however, you could continue using the same stack from the previous project.
